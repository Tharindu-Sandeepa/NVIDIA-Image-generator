# Nvidia Image Generator

This project is a web-based image generator powered by Nvidia's Stable Diffusion XL model. It enables users to create stunning, high-quality images from simple text descriptions. The generator is built using a React frontend and leverages Nvidia's API to produce artwork based on user input.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Input a description, and the model generates an image based on the given prompt.
- **Download Option**: Easily download generated images for further use.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized UI for various screen sizes, with user-friendly controls.

### Backend

This app interacts with Nvidia's [Stable Diffusion XL API](https://build.nvidia.com/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl?snippet_tab=Node). For full usage of the Nvidia API, create an account and set up the API as shown in the link. This will give you access to the model and necessary configurations for generating images with Nvidia's capabilities.
get an api key from that then put it inside a .env file .

## Usage

1. **Input Prompt**: Enter a detailed description of the image you want to generate.
2. **Generate Image**: Click the "Generate" button to start the image generation process. The model will return an image based on the prompt.
3. **Download**: Use the download button to save the generated image to your local device.

- "A serene sunset over a misty lake surrounded by mountains."
- "A vibrant cityscape at night with neon lights and reflections on wet streets."
- "A peaceful forest with rays of sunlight filtering through ancient trees."

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: Component library for responsive UI elements.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to Nvidia's API.
